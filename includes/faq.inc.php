                            To understand why the NATO members are so opposed, consider two very hypothetical scenarios:
                            First, imagine for a moment that NATO, which is already struggling to convince its easternmost
                            members that it would indeed fight for them if Russia should attack, were foolish enough to
                            encourage Ukraine to join. Ukraine, a divided and almost bankrupt nation of 45 million, would
                            first have to receive a Membership Action Plan and then meet its conditions -- a process that
                            would take many years. (Albania, which joined NATO in 2009, got its MAP in 1999.) So starting
                            the process would merely set the clock ticking for Russia to do whatever it takes to prevent
                            its neighbor from joining -- from rekindling the war to eastern Ukraine to making a full-scale
                            invasion.<br>
                            Next, imagine that Ukraine were, miraculously, to succeed in joining NATO. It would only further
                            destabilize the country. Even though Russia has lately done much to unite most Ukrainians against it,
                            the east of the country still has strong cultural and historical ties to Russia. As long as the Kremlin
                            sees and portrays NATO as a threat, a substantial share of Ukraine's population will want no part of it.
                            No doubt, Ukrainian politicians have reasons for talking tough about joining NATO, as they jostle for
                            position ahead of parliamentary elections next month. Yet this is a game their country cannot win. Ukraine
                            should instead offer a long-term pledge of neutrality as part of a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin
                            that would allow the country to develop whatever political and economic associations it wants.

                            The Russian parliament has passed a law barring foreign investors from owning more than a 20%
                            stake in the countryâ€™s media outlets. The move comes amid a propaganda war with the west over the Ukraine crisis.
                            The legislation, which was passed by the state Duma without debate on Friday with a vote of 430-2, forbids international
                            organisations and foreign citizens, companies and governments from founding or holding more than a 20% stake in Russian
                            media businesses. Although it will come into force at the start of 2016, media owners will have until 1 February 2017 to
                            bring their holdings into compliance.<br>
                            The editors and publishers of media outlets independent from state control have said the new legislation will
                            further reduce the diversity of opinion in the Russian media. Russian Forbes editor Elmar Murtazayev said the
                            publication would probably close if the law passed, since its German parent company Axel Springer did not want
                            to sell it to a Russian owner.
